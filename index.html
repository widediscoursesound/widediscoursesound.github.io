      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b>Introduction</b>
      </div>
      <p>I am Gregory Cohen and I'm a self-taught computer
      programmer and creator of a unique philosophical methodology
      who is also keen to business entrepreneurship and helping
      others to achieve success.</p>
      <p>I have done a variety of roles in my life, including doing
      Artificial Intelligence work for a Private Branch Exchange
      (PBX) VoIP Company based in North Carolina.</p>
      <p>I have also made websites for different entities. I know a
      variety of computer languages and have public code that is
      liked by hundreds of software developers.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b>Software and Entrepreneurship</b>
      </div>
      <p>As an aspiring entrepreneur, I have created many useful
      pieces of computer software, and have been involved in the
      formation of sales business along with many other business
      venture ideas.</p>
      <p>In the process of entrepreneurship, I have had people
      interested in cooperation or founding businesses with me -
      one individual, an old boss of mine, expressed interest in
      investment of Amazon-related business strategies with the
      prospect of investing up to 1.2 million of capital in me.</p>
      <p>Another individual (another boss of mine who was from
      Dubai) wanted to start a business with me. He had big
      connections and is friends with Steve Harvey and has played
      golf with him, and also has some connections to the music
      industry.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b>Music Passion, Networking & Connections</b>
      </div>
      <p>As for music, I have a great love of all genres of
      music.</p>
      <p>My cousin dated Virginia to Vegas (Canadian Platinum
      selling pop singer who plays on the radio all the time in
      Canada), I've met him more than once at family
      gatherings.</p>
      <p>I went to a school next to a school that Skrillex went to
      briefly, according to an old childhood friend of mine who
      went to the same school.</p>
      <p>I have long been interested in rap and hip-hop music,
      along with a wide and eclectic taste in music in general.</p>
      <p>I am a big fan of many popular music artists, such as
      Drake and Young Thug.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b>Why I'm Making This Label - Wide Discourse Sound</b>
      </div>
      <p>As I stated, I have long had an affinity for rap music,
      one of the most expressive genres that exist.</p>
      <p>Latent in the genre is a great potential for human
      expression and human articulation - a great poetry rather
      unmatched.</p>
      <p>I want to push boundaries and move things to the next
      level in expression. As such, it is time to start a new label
      to encourage this.</p>
      <p id='background'><br></p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b><big>Background</big></b>
      </div>
      <p>Sometimes, getting to where you want to go is a struggle.
      Indeed, I have been many places, heard many lies, and seen
      much self-defeating action.</p>
      <p>Before, I had the aspiration to get to the top to use
      their wide-reaching influence to change things. In some ways,
      this was a bit misguided.</p>
      <p>There is much power in taking full ownership and
      initiative, and in creating something new. This is what I am
      doing now. I am finding and curating the Best, Strongest and
      Most Confident music artists - music artists who don't give a
      f*#$ and are willing to break boundaries and tear things
      down, all because they are inalienably BOSS.</p>
      <p>I am finding people who have more confidence than artists
      like Rick Ross, and have more confidence than almost all in
      the industry. People who are willing to say anything and be
      the best.</p>
      <p>I have been lied to a lot and misguided a lot. It's time
      to find and make greats.</p>
      <p>I had been sucked into association with a bunch of fake
      idiots who were pretending to be Drake's crew (fake O.V.O.,
      fake X.O.), coupled with a fake contract listing Drake's
      House, and a whole range of other pathetic behavior. These
      people do one too many drugs, and here is me, being sober and
      clean as always. And I'm a non-judgmental man, I don't mind
      if people pop one too many pills, or do pills at all for that
      matter, but I'm not going to be lied to by those who aren't
      doing anything creative or fresh or constructive with their
      time, and are basically nobodies. And I mingled with such in
      spite of mistreatment to get to the light at the end of the
      tunnel, my only goal here was to influence culture, to be a
      positive influence. So after having had money stolen from me,
      now I am here, and I am starting this new venture. And it
      turns out you don't need to be at the top of the rap game to
      influence. You just gotta put yourself out there. And be
      confident. And I had the idea that to make a difference you
      would have to be at the top. And that can work, but
      grassroots also works, you can Start From The Bottom, and get
      High Up. I want to try both approaches at the speed of light
      - and waste as little time as possible. I don't give a damn
      if people do perks, weed, lean, anything. I don't do it, I
      don't judge. I am too busy to judge.</p>
      <p>My solution is Full Initiative - Full Ownership, a New
      Label.</p>
      <p>It's time to get things started.</p>
      <p style='text-transform: uppercase;'>Welcome to <b><i>Wide Discourse Sound</i></b>.</p>
      <p id="who"></p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b><big>Who We Want</big></b>
      </div>
      <p>We are finding select rappers who <em>have it</em>.
      Rappers who know they're the shit, who know they can say
      anything, who are mad bosses and know it.</p>
      <p>We are finding rappers who aren't afraid to talk about
      things that most don't talk about, because they're too weak.
      Things like Scientology.</p>
      <p>Huge topic, something to be down to the ground, down to
      earth about.</p>
      <p>We want rappers who are unencumbered by peer pressure or
      groups telling them what to be, or what to think.</p>
      <p>Now, a lot of the biggest rappers can talk about this
      stuff - what's the issue here?</p>
      <p>The issue here is there's tons of based, true shit in
      this.</p>
      <p>And there is so much sanctimony and idiocy on discussion
      of this. The solution is not to discuss, but be dominated by
      rappers who know they are the shit. Because when you hear
      them you'll know it.</p>
      <p>People stronger than Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, etc., who
      exude confidence as part of their being.</p>
      <p>Rappers like Rick Ross somewhat get it, that's why there
      is already some music on this (see below) in the mainstream
      to some extent.</p>
      <p>But a true boss would go into the depth of it, into
      feelings and get what there is. There would be no fake LA
      nonsense here.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, those who are able to speak are more boss
      than those who can't, who are confused.</p>
      <p>Is confusion a dominant state? No.</p>
      <p>Is being controlled by a group a dominant state? No.</p>
      <p>Is erratic lunacy a dominant state? No.</p>
      <p>So anyone who is reserved on this is not boss.</p>

      <big><b>Analysis of this song</b></big>
      <ul style='text-align: left;'><li>It's very not polarized. Very neutral song. This is a complement.</li>
      <li>Sort of born out of ignorance, but that's fine. That's what this Label is for.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Where you must sign a life long contract as well&rdquo; will not be true for this label. It's very important to treat members of this label with brotherhood and compassion.</li>
      <li>It associates things with money, everything with money. &ldquo;Put the salaries aside&rdquo; is a great line. Because money ain't got nothing to do with anything here. </li>
      <li>It has vague, confused religious ideas. Nothing about <i>this</i> label has anything to do with constricting people or religion. This label is all about breaking boundaries. Hopefully Maybach Music and Young Money and O.V.O. are similar.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Scientology prophets you better stay in your lane. Let me roll up some green&rdquo; doesn't really make sense, unless it's about a Label like this. And actually I have no issue with Rick Ross making money, I mean he goes to Grant Cardone's conventions. But Grant Cardone in many ways is the antithesis of what this label is about - profundity, depth, exploration, detail-oriented focus, introspection, recognition of pain, empathy. Grant Cardone doesn't have those qualities that much. A lot of people are bittersweet about the guy. Another interpretation would be that he is saying, the lane for people who would speak first about Scientology would be music, which might be true.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Looking at B.I.G and Pac imagining all the profits&rdquo; doesn't make much sense, actually it borders on blatant conspiracy theorism.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;See Confederate flags but I got a flag of mine. Yeah, yeah I got a Flag of mine!" is an awesome lyric. I'm not going to lie. Sure does seem this way. With the latter &ldquo;flag&rdquo; representing Freedom and such. The lyric is ambiguous and has multiple interpretations.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Yeah, bang we can do it then! I got that money from Lil Wayne lets do it yeah&rdquo; By all means ... Lil Wayne could do great things, even more great things.</li>
      <li>There are many, many, many themes this song does not touch, from detached academics who want to run away from things, to free speech and the struggle of it, to compassion, love and empathy, to science, to instituional structures (I guess referring to Tupac is a hint at criticism of structures, Tupac was a Communist, love it or hate it). There's a million avenues Ross did not go in here.</li>

      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <b><big>For The Business Obsessed</big></b>
      </div>
      <p>One of the reasons why hip-hop has resonated with so many
      people and so broadly taken over popular music and discourse
      is because it is humble, not self-righteous and appeals to a
      very broad crowd. There is a low-key aspect that is easy to
      consume, it is not trying to tell you how to live or subject
      someone to a lower role.</p>
      <p>I am trying to broaden the range of discourse by creating
      more meaningful music. That might sound like buzzwords, but I
      mean - I want to incorporate ideas from different sources and
      do novel and edgy things lyrically. The issue with people is
      they are too uptight, if one introduced influences from say
      Scientology, not only would that lead to really interesting
      new music creations which could be a really positive thing
      for different artists' careers, it could also lead to fake
      controversy, which would attract attention and let's be real
      it would sell. So from a business perspective, this is a
      really good and unique idea, and from a moral standpoint
      (free speech, learning new things about different cultures,
      making people less uptight, pushing norms), this is great as
      well.</p>
      <p>Charli D'Amelio did just fine, as did Drake, and Kanye
      (I'm thinking &ldquo;Energy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clique&rdquo; respectively), and Rick
      Ross (who had a song called Scientology even though he's not
      a Scientologist) did well, and of course this has worked well
      for Skrillex.</p>
      <p>But these guys don't have <u>meaningful</u> music in this
      way, and that's where I can assist with this - and in turn,
      lead to a hell of a lot of good things including increased
      profits.</p>
      <p>Controversy sells and attracts attention = more revenue
      for artists signed to labels and for producers = virality =
      greater career prospects for all involved</p>
      <p>Meaningfulness, sells.</p>
      <p>Substance and defiantness, sells.</p>
      <p>Hip-hop and R&B, sells.</p>
      <p>Down to earthness and humbleness, sells.</p>
      <p>People need to become less sanctimonious/self-righteous,
      more intelligent, and more exploratory (culturally,
      lyrically, hell, even scientifically).</p>

      <br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><b>What ought to be done:</b></div>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Tap into so-called controversy.</li> <br>
      <li>Artist should seem like independent powerful agent of his own -
      any time there is some area of sanctimony or one feels like they can't talk about
      this, break it.</li> <br>
      <li>Producers collaborate with rappers to bring this
      about. I created software that can help generate meaningful
      music, all without the use of any AI (hand-crafted code and
      software by me) - such could contribute in part to a lyrical
      basis or inspiration for rappers.</li></ul>

  <p>The following enumerates 18 universalistic moral principles to not do, such that the outcome is better.</p>

  <p>Famously, the Old Testament lists 10 principles, many of which say "Thou Shalt Not".</p>

  <p>These 18 things are "Thou Shalt Not"s, which, if applied and upheld, would lead to a better society.</p>


  <p>The quotes here are verbatim quotes I heave experienced.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>"Yeah, they haven't received much good press." - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>1) Obsessive attention to misinformation, disinformation or malinformation (M.D.M.) without the excercise of cognitive faculaties to Disambiguate, Clarify or meta-awareness of the potential of the information being partial or M.D.M.</p>

  <p>2) An obsessive desire to maintain the influence of any narrative on their minds that confuses matters more, a PR or propaganda obsession (but only if it's negative), a strange context-specific obsession to care about what the media says (even if the individual might disregard the media in other cases).</p>

  <p>3) An obsessive desire to maintain the status quo.</p>

  <p>(The following circumstance is true if and only if one grants validity to partial narratives and M.D.M. that has been propagated, such as books against organizations etc.</p>





  <blockquote>
  <p>"Are they not very protective of their doctrine?" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4) General toleration of uncertainty about other groups.</p>
  <p>5) Bias towards a given narrative (that they would be protective of).</p>
  <p>6) Assuming things are secret.</p>




  <p>"It is possible, but We could never do it, because it's so secret." - Guy in Western Canada</p>



  <blockquote>
  <p>"Dianetics and the annihilation of thetons has been exposed by a lot of people who have left the community as a way to extract money while drip feeding the program over time." - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>See 6 - Assuming things are secret.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>"exposed" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Extremely open. 99% of the material is available, you can torrent it. Extremely open. (And I said this at a secular group and they got overwhelmed and ran away.) Again, see 6.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"community" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>7) Organization-obsession. Assuming that Scientology is an organization, as opposed to definitionally, it is an applied religious philosophy (It got forced into a religious context for various reasons.) It is also a body of knowledge and findings, desparately and in an open-source fashion, begging to be tested and talked about. It is an applied body of knowledge or science.</p>
  <p>8) Obsessive disrespect of anything in the context of Scientology or ANY science categorically. This manifests itself in COVID denialism, anti-science, etc. I heard someone say about the COVID lockdowns, etc. "This is not science! It is Scientology. It's not science." Here "thetan", the individual themselves, the conciousness of the individual that is capable of operating and doing things and creating, is being disrepected by misspelling the name, obsessively. Thetans are a basic principle in Scientology that everyone would learn on day 1 in a Scientology context (church, reading a book, scholarly, etc. - any context.)</p>
  <p>9) Denialism of suffering / denialism of individual identity - A thetan in Scientology is a Life Unit, the individual. In Scientology, thetans have experienced a lot. It comes from the word "theta", which in Scientology means "life". Interestingly, in Greek, it means "death", but it can mean "life" in a variety of ways, and, indeed, "death", pre-assumes "life" for there to be "death" at all. (See interesting Quora article on this, if you want.) In Scientology, thetans have gone through a long duration of time in decline, the idea is that now, we should be smart and do actions that improve the condition of Thetans, life units, us, our concious, the awareness of awareness units. And inasmuch as the entire body of material from 1948 and 1950 onwards was unequivically and defiantly open, it was trying to get talked, the entire body of material, in mainstream BioTech, psychiatry, psychology, biology, physics, and any and all branch of science. It is defiantly OPEN.</p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>"as a way to extract money" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"It's all about money!" - Guy in Ottawa</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>10) Money whine. Debasing any discussion of a given topic. Instead of transactions being money for value, the value is obsessively omitted from the conception, leading to only ideas of money.</p>




  <blockquote>
  <p>"drip feeding the program" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is so delusional about secrecy that I cannot comprehend it. It is tantamount to a severe form of autism. I have no issues with people with Aspergers, but this is worse than most people with Aspergers or high-spectrum people. See 6, "Organization obsession" and "Money whine"</p>



  <blockquote>
  <p>"over time" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>11) Slow down narrative. Scientologists are IMPATIENT. Scientologists want things done, NOW. There is no over time in Scientology.</p>



  <blockquote>
  <p>"Is that inaccurate?" - Guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>12) Fake desire for accuracy.</p>
  <p>13) Fake representation of desire to have an accurate narrative. See first points (1 - 3)</p>





  <blockquote>
  <p>"THAT is bullshit" - <span style='font-weight: normal; font-style:normal;'>A guy in Ottawa who was running a secular meetup group who got overwhelmed right in the middle of the group when one member was humbly corrected, then awkwardly and in violation of all social mores ran away from his own group he was hosting. Then he started yelling into the air like a 3 year old for no reason. This is NORMAL behavior, not just for "secularists".</span></p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>14) A desirate to separate. Segregationism. Separationism. A desire to say "THAT" (as opposed to "this", or saying nothing)</p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>"I am curious, you claim it's a free speech constraint that is preventing people from adopting Scientology's values. Isn't the onus on the messenger to deliver a compelling enough case and sufficient evidence to earn the adoption? In what way is there an imposition on your free speech?" - A guy in Western Canada</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>15) Onus delusion. Acting as if communication has not been done for 75 years. Acting as if, speech always gets listened to and internalized.</p>

  <p>Another instance of "Obsessive disrespect of anything in the context of Scientology or ANY science categorically.", because the individual was thinking I was talking about Scientology's VALUES, when I was talking about the "mainstream scientific establishment".</p>

  <p>This kind of quote is why Trump won/Trump "needed" to win (depending on the individual's perspective). This is show-off, alpha male, tough guy mindset. It acts as if there is someone who seems "strong" and the other people "have to" listen. This is a hidden support of authoritarianism. In reality, oftentimes in real life, there is someone trying to speak a message, but other people do not listen. Historically and in the current world, this is very, very normal, in all contexts.</p>



  <blockquote>
  <p>"I am looking at it here. It's not hidden, it just suffers from a bad reputation."</p>
  </blockquote>


  <p>See previous points.</p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>"According to some, RLH made extreme claims of the potential capacity of a Clear. The claims never came to fruition and the church loved the goal posts."</p>

  <p>"Also, the measures are all subjective, discounting it from standard scientific practice. "</p>
  </blockquote>



  <p>My response:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"The initial Dianetic definition of Clear is high, yes. A clear in modern terminology is someone who doesn't have a reactive mind, one part of the case. There is more case besides just the reactive mind.</p>

  <p>Also, the measures are not subjective. As for clear, that can be defined accurately. The person would lack the case that forms the reactive mind.</p>

  <p>In regards to exteriorizarion and mental mass and a variety of other phenomena, those are empirical and reproducible.</p>

  <p>I would say the initial Dianetic goal of clear was somewhat of an exaggeration as regards certain circumstances, but such might have been par for the course at the time to get attention. However, that was Dianetics. Once the greater expanse of spiritual existence was found, it became a new subject, Scientology. Of course, just as with the development of any body of knowledge, some earlier claims could be proven not 100% accurate. There is more memory than just the present life. And chronic pains and ailments could be solved, even for those who only believe in just one life and have a materialistic mindset, by addressing the broader scope of a beings spiritual existence. And as such, a new subject was formed, Scientology.</p>

  <p>In no way, whatsoever, can it or should it be discounted from standard scientific practice. And in no way are there subjective or non reproducible criteria."</p>
  </blockquote>




  <b><p>Notes</p></b>



  <p>Another instance of "Obsessive disrespect of anything in the context of Scientology or ANY science categorically." (RLH) (See also, Tmoahs Eoidsn, and Siacs Netown, for instances of this pathology.)</p>


  <p>16) Obsession of relativism versus Universalism. Declaration of things being subjective arbitrarily, when no subjectivity is part of the subject. Moreover, initial processes are literally called Objective processes, to increase objectivity (in this case in this context, such would mean a focus on the environment. In the context of science, objectivity would mean that something can be peer-reviewed and tested and found independent of previous findings, and that certain axioms and postulates are clear and universal.)</p>
