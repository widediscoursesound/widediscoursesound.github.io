Record Label</big></b></div><br><br><div style=text-align:center><b>About Me - Background, Portfolio and Who I Am</b></div><br><br><div style=text-align:center><b>Introduction</b></div><p>I am Gregory Cohen and I'm a self-taught computer programmer and creator of a unique philosophical methodology who is also keen to business entrepreneurship and helping others to achieve success.</p><p>I have done a variety of roles in my life, including doing Artificial Intelligence work for a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) VoIP Company based in North Carolina.</p><p>I have also made websites for different entities. I know a variety of computer languages and have public code that is liked by hundreds of software developers.</p><div style=text-align:center><b>Software and Entrepreneurship</b></div><p>As an aspiring entrepreneur, I have created many useful pieces of computer software, and have been involved in the formation of sales business along with many other business venture ideas.</p><p>In the process of entrepreneurship, I have had people interested in cooperation or founding businesses with me - one individual, an old boss of mine, expressed interest in investment of Amazon-related business strategies with the prospect of investing up to 1.2 million of capital in me.</p><p>Another individual (another boss of mine who was from Dubai) wanted to start a business with me. He had big connections and is friends with Steve Harvey and has played golf with him, and also has some connections to the music industry.</p><div style=text-align:center><b>Music Passion, Networking & Connections</b></div><p>As for music, I have a great love of all genres of music.</p><p>My cousin dated Virginia to Vegas (Canadian Platinum selling pop singer who plays on the radio all the time in Canada), I've met him more than once at family gatherings.</p><p>I went to a school next to a school that Skrillex went to briefly, according to an old childhood friend of mine who went to the same school.</p><p>I have long been interested in rap and hip-hop music, along with a wide and eclectic taste in music in general.</p><p>I am a big fan of many popular music artists, such as Drake and Young Thug.</p><div style=text-align:center><b>Why I'm Making This Label - Wide Discourse Sound</b></div><p>As I stated, I have long had an affinity for rap music, one of the most expressive genres that exist.</p><p>Latent in the genre is a great potential for human expression and human articulation - a great poetry rather unmatched.</p><p>I want to push boundaries and move things to the next level in expression. As such, it is time to start a new label to encourage this.</p><p id=background><br></p><div style=text-align:center><b><big>Background</big></b></div><p>Sometimes, getting to where you want to go is a struggle. Indeed, I have been many places, heard many lies, and seen much self-defeating action.</p><p>Before, I had the aspiration to get to the top to use their wide-reaching influence to change things. In some ways, this was a bit misguided.</p><p>There is much power in taking full ownership and initiative, and in creating something new. This is what I am doing now. I am finding and curating the Best, Strongest and Most Confident music artists - music artists who don't give a f*#$ and are willing to break boundaries and tear things down, all because they are inalienably BOSS.</p><p>I am finding people who have more confidence than artists like Rick Ross, and have more confidence than almost all in the industry. People who are willing to say anything and be the best.</p><p>I have been lied to a lot and misguided a lot. It's time to find and make greats.</p><p>I had been sucked into association with a bunch of fake idiots who were pretending to be Drake's crew (fake O.V.O., fake X.O.), coupled with a fake contract listing Drake's House, and a whole range of other pathetic behavior. These people do one too many drugs, and here is me, being sober and clean as always. And I'm a non-judgmental man, I don't mind if people pop one too many pills, or do pills at all for that matter, but I'm not going to be lied to by those who aren't doing anything creative or fresh or constructive with their time, and are basically nobodies. And I mingled with such in spite of mistreatment to get to the light at the end of the tunnel, my only goal here was to influence culture, to be a positive influence. So after having had money stolen from me, now I am here, and I am starting this new venture. And it turns out you don't need to be at the top of the rap game to influence. You just gotta put yourself out there. And be confident. And I had the idea that to make a difference you would have to be at the top. And that can work, but grassroots also works, you can Start From The Bottom, and get High Up. I want to try both approaches at the speed of light - and waste as little time as possible. I don't give a damn if people do perks, weed, lean, anything. I don't do it, I don't judge. I am too busy to judge.</p><p>My solution is Full Initiative - Full Ownership, a New Label.</p><p>It's time to get things started.</p><p style=text-transform:uppercase>Welcome to <b><i>Wide Discourse Sound</i></b>.</p><p id=who></p><div style=text-align:center><b><big>Who We Want</big></b></div><p>We are finding select rappers who <em>have it</em>. Rappers who know they're the shit, who know they can say anything, who are mad bosses and know it.</p><p>We are finding rappers who aren't afraid to talk about things that most don't talk about, because they're too weak. Things like Scientology.</p><p>Huge topic, something to be down to the ground, down to earth about.</p><p>We want rappers who are unencumbered by peer pressure or groups telling them what to be, or what to think.</p><p>Now, a lot of the biggest rappers can talk about this stuff - what's the issue here?</p><p>The issue here is there's tons of based, true shit in this.</p><p>And there is so much sanctimony and idiocy on discussion of this. The solution is not to discuss, but be dominated by rappers who know they are the shit. Because when you hear them you'll know it.</p><p>People stronger than Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, etc., who exude confidence as part of their being.</p><p>Rappers like Rick Ross somewhat get it, that's why there is already some music on this (see below) in the mainstream to some extent.</p><p>But a true boss would go into the depth of it, into feelings and get what there is. There would be no fake LA nonsense here.</p><p>Needless to say, those who are able to speak are more boss than those who can't, who are confused.</p><p>Is confusion a dominant state? No.</p><p>Is being controlled by a group a dominant state? No.</p><p>Is erratic lunacy a dominant state? No.</p><p>So anyone who is reserved on this is not boss.</p><br><br><br><br></div></section><section id=s2><div id=iframe_box><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kq8AGOD3rUo?si=SkKzrNIV_jWKtl2C" title="YouTube video player" width=560></iframe><p><b>You would need to be more lyrically adept and meaningful than this.<br><br><a href=javascript:; id=analysis>This song is interesting for many reasons.

Very neutral song. This is a complement.</li><li>Sort of born out of ignorance, but that's fine. That's what this Label is for.</li><li>“Where you must sign a life long contract as well” will not be true for this label. It's very important to treat members of this label with brotherhood and compassion.</li><li>It associates things with money, everything with money. “Put the salaries aside” is a great line. Because money ain't got nothing to do with anything here.</li><li>It has vague, confused religious ideas. Nothing about <i>this</i> label has anything to do with constricting people or religion. This label is all about breaking boundaries. Hopefully Maybach Music and Young Money and O.V.O. are similar.</li><li>“Scientology prophets you better stay in your lane. Let me roll up some green” doesn't really make sense, unless it's about a Label like this. And actually I have no issue with Rick Ross making money, I mean he goes to Grant Cardone's conventions. But Grant Cardone in many ways is the antithesis of what this label is about - profundity, depth, exploration, detail-oriented focus, introspection, recognition of pain, empathy. Grant Cardone doesn't have those qualities that much. A lot of people are bittersweet about the guy. Another interpretation would be that he is saying, the lane for people who would speak first about Scientology would be music, which might be true.</li><li>“Looking at B.I.G and Pac imagining all the profits” doesn't make much sense, actually it borders on blatant conspiracy theorism.</li><li>“See Confederate flags but I got a flag of mine. Yeah, yeah I got a Flag of mine!" is an awesome lyric. I'm not going to lie. Sure does seem this way. With the latter “flag” representing Freedom and such. The lyric is ambiguous and has multiple interpretations.</li><li>“Yeah, bang we can do it then! I got that money from Lil Wayne lets do it yeah” By all means ... Lil Wayne could do great things, even more great things.</li><li>There are many, many, many themes this song does not touch, from detached academics who want to run away from things, to free speech and the struggle of it, to compassion, love and empathy, to science, to instituional structures (I guess referring to Tupac is a hint at criticism of structures, Tupac was a Communist, love it or hate it). There's a million avenues Ross did not go in here.</li></ul></div></div></b></p><br><br><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulHB2mNlovg?si=Wc9zhZugntMcvdgP" title="YouTube video player" width=560></iframe><p><b>You would actually come up with meaningful music unlike Skrillex.</b></p><br><br><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LnBvuzjpr4?si=EtgpCyV6X4WR78Mi" title="YouTube video player" width=560></iframe><p><b>Drake has great introspective lyrics, but this could be better.</b></p><br><br><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oxr9XWogBQA?si=e-K5GqmVkt3S5stN" title="YouTube video player" width=560></iframe><p><b>Certainly “cliques” or closed-off-ness has nothing to do with Boss Rap at all.

There is a low-key aspect that is easy to consume, it is not trying to tell you how to live or subject someone to a lower role.</p><p>I am trying to broaden the range of discourse by creating my meaningful music. That might sound like buzzwords, but I mean - I want to incorporate ideas from different sources and do novel and edgy things lyrically. The issue with people is they are too uptight, if one introduced influences from say Scientology, not only would that lead to really interesting new music creations which could be a really positive thing for different artists careers, it could also lead to fake controversy, which would attract attention and let's be real it would sell. So from a business perspective, this is a really good and unique idea, and from a moral standpoint (free speech, learning new things about different cultures, making people less uptight, pushing norms), this is great as well.</p><p>Charli D'Amelio did just fine, as did Drake, and Kanye (I'm thinking “Energy” and “Clique” respectively), and Rick Ross (who had a song called Scientology even though he's not a Scientologist) did well, and of course this has worked well for Skrillex.</p><p>But these guys don't have <u>meaningful</u> music in this way, and that's where I can assist with this - and in turn, lead to a hell of a lot of good things including increased profits.</p><p>Controversy sells and attracts attention = more revenue for artists signed to labels and for producers = virality = greater career prospects for all involved</p><p>Meaningfulness, sells.</p><p>Substance and defiantness, sells.</p><p>Hip-hop and R&B, sells.</p><p>Down to earthness and humbleness, sells.</p><p>People need to become less sanctimonious / self righteous, more intelligent, and more exploratory (culturally, lyrically, hell, even scientifically).</p><br><div style=text-align:center><b>What ought to be done:</b></div><br><br><ul><li>Tap into so called controversy.</li><br><li>Artist should seem like independent powerful agent of his own - any time there is some area of sanctimony or one feels like they can't talk about this, break it.</li><br><li>Producers collaborate with rappers to bring this about. I created software that can help generate meaningful music, all without the use of any AI (hand-crafted code and software by me) - such could contribute in part to a lyrical basis or inspiration for rappers.</li></ul><br><br><div style=padding-bottom:8px;text-align:center><b><big>Business Model</big></b></div><p>Our focus is rap, R&B, pop and electronic.</p><p>We will find and sign music artists of these popular genres to our label.</p><p><b>Mission Statement:</b> To find and sign confident music artists to our record label to Widen the Discourse and produce powerful music.</p><p><b>Vision:</b> A music scene where rappers and music artists can rap about any topic, without having to respect the status quo.</p><p>The particular logistics of Research and Planning, Legal Structure, Business Plan Creation, Branding, Team Building, Artist Signing, Distribution, Marketing and Promotion, Networking and Financial Management are being worked out as we speak.</p><div style=text-align:center><div id=plans><br><br><big><b>Our Plans</b></big><br><br><br></div><div class=imageContainer><img alt="Image 1" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-antoni-shkraba-production-8412278.jpg class=galleryImage> <img alt="Image 2" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-donald-tong-66134.jpg class=galleryImage> <img alt="Image 3" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-ficky-2364381.jpg class=galleryImage></div><div class=imageContainer><img alt="Image 1" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-brett-sayles-4001269.jpg class=galleryImage> <img alt="Image 2" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-luis-quintero-3101522.jpg class=galleryImage> <img alt="Image 3" src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widediscoursesound/widediscoursesound/main/images/pexels-aleksandr-neplokhov-1238978.jpg class=galleryImage></div></div><br><br><div style=text-align:center><i>W.D.S. is a Western Canada based record label, currently based in Edmonton, Alberta.</i></div><br><br><br><br><br><center><a href=#top id=top_nav class=top-link style=text-decoration:none>↑ Top</a></center><br><br><br><br><br><br></div></section><footer><a href=mailto:widediscoursesound@gmail.com>widediscoursesound@gmail.com</a> • <a href=discord:// >discord @wdsrecords</a> • <a href=https://www.facebook.com/wdsrecordlabel>fb</a> • <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/wide-discourse-sound-record-label-42288a2b7/ >linkedin</a></footer><script>function toggle(e){const t=(e=document.getElementById(e)).style,n=document.getElementById("analysis"),o=n.style;"0"==t.opacity?(o.color="rgb(127, 127, 200)",t.opacity="1",t.height="1100px",t.color="white",t.letterSpacing="",t.transform=""):(o.color="white",t.opacity="0",t.color="gold",t.height="0px",t.letterSpacing="auto",t.transform="rotate(0deg)",e.blur()),n.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",(function(){document.getElementById("analysis").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),toggle("u1")})),document.getElementById("top_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("top").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})})),document.getElementById("plans_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("plans").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})})),document.getElementById("about_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("about").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})})),document.getElementById("background_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("about").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})})),document.getElementById("who_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("who").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})})),document.getElementById("business_nav").addEventListener("click",(function(e){e.preventDefault(),document.getElementById("business").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})}))}));const images=document.querySelectorAll("img"),exceptions=[document.getElementById("logo")];images.forEach((e=>{e.addEventListener("click",(function(){exceptions.includes(e)||window.open(e.src,"_blank")}))}))</script></html>
